I am a Software Engineer with a Bachelor’s degree in [Computer Engineering](https://www.ing-inm.unifi.it) from the [Università degli Studi di Firenze](https://www.unifi.it/it), and I am currently completing my Master’s in the same field.

I am deeply passionate about problem-solving, using every skill and piece of knowledge I have to tackle challenges. Furthermore, I am driven not only by what I know but also by an enthusiasm for learning whatever it takes to create effective solutions.

Each project represents an opportunity to learn, grow, and innovate, which I bring into every codebase, application, and team environment I join.

My commitment to open-source development drives my passion for collaboration and knowledge sharing. I actively contribute to community-driven projects where diverse perspectives merge. This collaboration enhances the quality of our work and promotes a culture of continuous learning.

Alongside tech, I have a strong creative side. I have had a passion for graphic design since I was 13. A collection of my early work is available for viewing at [deviantart.com/braddolo](https://deviantart.com/braddolo).

I am also a music enthusiast and enjoy running. I have played tennis and soccer in the past, and recently, I have also developed a passion for volleyball.

Feel free to explore my work or get in touch — I’m always open to new opportunities and ideas!
