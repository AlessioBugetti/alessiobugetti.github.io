I'm a [Computer Engineering](https://www.ing-inm.unifi.it) graduate from the [Università degli Studi di Firenze](https://www.unifi.it/it) with a deep passion for coding. I love creating clean, efficient code and enjoy contributing to open-source projects that make a difference. Beyond the world of tech, I’m also an avid sports enthusiast, with a particular love for football, tennis, and volleyball.

Feel free to explore my work or get in touch — I’m always open to new opportunities and ideas!
